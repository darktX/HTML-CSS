        Just ten miles north of Santa Cruz, a battered black-and-yellow pickup sits rusting
        in the grass along a gorgeous stretch of coastal California highway. From its bed
        rises a huge strawberry-shaped silhouette of red-painted wood with green tufts
        sprouting from its top to mimic leaves. A sign behind the truck says “Jam Tasting”
        and points past an aging wooden barn to the headquarters of Swanton Berry Farm—the
        first organic unionized farm in America.

        The terms “organic” and “unionized” rarely appear together for a reason.
        Gaining organic certification and unionizing workers is expensive and time-consuming.
        To farmers already operating with tight profit margins, the prospect of doing both
        can be daunting. Bruce Goldstein, president of the Washington, D.C., nonprofit Farmworker
        Justice, estimates that of the roughly 2.5 million farmworkers in America, only around
        25,000 are unionized. And only a small percent of those 25,000 work on organic farms.

        Beauty in nature has historically been a
        prevalent theme in art and books,
        filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and
        celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the
        strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this
        association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the
        branch of philosophy called aesthetics. Beyond certain basic characteristics
        that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the
        opinions are virtually endless. Nature and wildness have been important
        subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of landscape art began
        in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The tradition of representing nature as
        it is became one of the aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in
        Asian art. Although natural wonders are celebrated in the Psalms and the Book of Job,
        wilderness portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in
        the works of the Romantic movement. British artists John Constable
        and J. M. W. Turner turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the
        natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily
        of religious scenes or of human beings. William Wordsworth's poetry described
        the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening
        place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.
        This artistic movement also coincided with the Transcendentalist movement in the
        Western world. A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word mimesis,
        the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the
        perfect is implied through perfect mathematical forms and more generally by patterns in
        nature. As David Rothenburg writes, "The beautiful is the root of science and the goal
        of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see
